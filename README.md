## Usage

First off, you'll need to fill a `.env` file. You can use the `.env.example` file as a template, or if you're lazy, just:
```bash
./scripts/create_env_files.sh
```

To start everything, simply run:

```bash
# with modern compose
docker compose up --build -d

# or with legacy cli
docker-compose up --build -d
```

Alternatively, a GNU make `Makefile` is provided, with the `up` and `down` rules, for your convenience.
